# Name Variations App

Welcome to the Name Variations App! This mini-project was created to help me practice my JavaScript skills by creating a simple application that generates variations of a given name.

## Overview

The Name Variations App takes a user-inputted name and generates different variations based on predefined rules. These variations include lowercase, uppercase, alternating case, reversed, and more. It also counts a number of characters in the given name. 

## Usage

To use the Name Variations App:

1. Enter a name into the input field.
2. View the generated variations below the input field.
